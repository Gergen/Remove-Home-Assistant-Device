# Remove Home Assistant Device

Documentation goes here...

This wasn't designed to be shared, so you'll have to pretend I did a good job of documenting it. ;)

Invoke it with the name of the entity you want to remove.

WARNING: this works directly in your .storage directory. That should make you uncomfortable, so make sure to try it on a backup first.
